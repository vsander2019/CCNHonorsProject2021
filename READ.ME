This repository should have my header file, main program, essay / project reflection and this read.me file.

I complied with clang++ -std=c++11 network.cpp using wasp.cs.kent.edu.

My program output has the movement of the packets hop to hop and then at the end their total delay. You can see in the code where the source and destination is for each. 
There is one that goes from each of the nodes and then extras to test different variables.

Thank you.
